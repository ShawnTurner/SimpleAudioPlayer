# Simple Audio Player #

A lean php mini-site that can be dropped into the root of a music library for convenient playback.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download this repo, and host it on a php enabled server. index.php should be the default document.
* Create a subfolder named "music", and organize your library into folders by album. Each folder corresponds to an album name.
* Listen to an album by visiting your website as "http://mylamphost.com/index.php?album=KillEmAll"
